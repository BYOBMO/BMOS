Viewing Images:
To view images you have stored in BMO's memory
open View->Photos in the top menu bar. This will
display a list of photos BMO has stored for
you. Select one to view.

Adding New Images:
If you have more photos you want BMO to store,
Put them on a USB stick and plug it into the
front USB port. Open the drive using the drive
icon in the lower left of the desktop. Select
an image you want to store and then drag it to
the image list.

Deleting Images:
To delete and image, just drag it from the
image list to the trash can. The image should
be gone forever (hopefully).
