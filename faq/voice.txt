VOICE RECOGNITION

Turn on voice recognition with menu option
Edit->Audio

Yes! BMO will listen to you. Will he obey? 
That depends on what you have to say.

And you will need Google Voice set up.

Unfortunately it's a bit complicated getting
BMO to listen.

Follow the directions here to get started:

Once you have that set up, press and hold the
read button (yes the red one! BMO will make
a derp face inidcating that he is listening.
If you say something intelligent, or BMO thinks
it's intelligent, you should get a response.

Some things to say:
Hello.
Are you a robot?
It's my birthday.
What time is it?
What do homies do?
Open the pod bay doors.
Are you an iPad?
Can I push the red button?
Let's go on an adventure!
